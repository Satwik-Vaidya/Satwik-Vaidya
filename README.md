## My Projects 


AI-based system for real-time flood prediction and smart response planning in urban areas.

- Developed a machine learning pipeline integrating rainfall, terrain elevation, and drainage data.
- Implemented predictive models (ANN, Random Forest) for real-time flood risk classification.
- Integrated visualization of affected zones using Matplotlib and Folium.
### Interactive Dashboard (Upcoming)
- React-based web interface for city administrators.
- Displays live sensor data, rainfall intensity, and predicted risk zones.
- Planned integration with Google Maps API for dynamic visual overlay.
### Key Highlights
- Real-time data ingestion via IoT sensors.
- Model trained on multi-year rainfall and terrain datasets.
- Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Folium.
### Future Scope
- Automated emergency routing using Graph-based optimization.
- Integration with government data APIs for live flood warnings.
